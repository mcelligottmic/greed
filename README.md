Greed
The game of take all - win all

Players: 2-4
Style: turn based; strategy; puzzle

Players start off in a queue and will be uniquely numbered.
There is a queue of items that will move towards the players.
The first 7 items in the queue are visible to all players, but the rest are hidden.
Each player will take a turn taking the closets set of items starting with player 1. 
The players MUST take a set of 1, 2, or 3 of the next items in queue.
Upon selecting the value of the set a player will remove those items from the queue. (would a bomb stop items after it from being selected by the player?)
All items in a set will be activated by the player and removed from the queue.
Item Queue:
There are 100 items in a game.

Bombs: explode when a player grabs it. This take out a playerâ€™s life points.
